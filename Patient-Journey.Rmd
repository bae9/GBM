## Data Prep

```{r data-prep}

studies <- read_excel(path, sheet="Studies")
arms <- read_excel(path, sheet="Arms")
dropout <- read_excel(path, sheet="Dropout")

  mutate(NCT = as.factor(NCT))

arms <- arms %>%
  mutate(NCT = as.factor(NCT)
        ,Arm = as.factor(Arm)
        )

dropout <- dropout %>%
  mutate(NCT = as.factor(NCT)
        ,Arm = as.factor(Arm)
        ,Reason = as.factor(Reason)
        )

dropoutsum <- dropout %>%
  group_by(NCT, Arm) %>%
    summarize(Sum = sum(Dropouts, na.rm=FALSE))
```

## Integrity Checks
```{r integrity-checks}
stopifnot(nlevels(dropout$Arm) == nlevels(arms$Arm))
duped <- dropout %>%
  group_by(Arm) %>%
  summarize(duped = length(unique(NCT)) > 1)
arm_names_unique <- all(!duped$duped)
stopifnot(all(!duped$duped))

## Patient Burden (Blake)

This is just a trivial addition by DCN, to check whether we've
got the CRLF-vs-CR issue sorted out. Also, it demonstrates the
syntax for a comment outside of a code chunk.

```{r IV-2, fig.height=5, fig.cap="TODO: Caption this figure."}
# Demonstrating a customary pattern of statistical work,
# in which we create an 'analysis dataset' that 'denormalizes'
# the input data.
# Normalization serves crucially important data-integrity aims,
# but these hinder analysis.
#
# To get an analysis dataset suitable for the contrasts
# you explored in the 2 boxplots, we need the following
# functional dependencies represented within each row
# of our analysis table:
# (1) Arm --> Enrollment
# (2) Arm -- Dropouts (of a certain kind)
# (3) Arm --> Universal IV (T/F)
# NB1: Because we asserted that the Arm names are unique,
#      we don't need to 'supplement' our key with NCT #'s.
#      (The Arm column alone suffices as a unique key.)
# NB2: Being selective about which columns to retain
#      in the analysis dataset will help make the tables
#      easier to list at the console and to keep track of
#      mentally. But in general, we might normally retain
#      all of the columns of -arms- in such work.

wc <- arms %>% # 'Withdrew Consent'
  select(Arm, Enrollment, "Universal IV") %>% # see NB2 above
  left_join(select(dropout, -NCT), by="Arm") %>% # see NB1 above
  mutate(WC = Reason %in% c("Withdrawal by Subject"
                           ,"Study Compliance"
                           ,"Lost to Follow-up" # TODO: Discuss whether to include this.
                           ,"Patient Refusal"
                           ) # Note WC is a *logical* (T/F) var at this point...
        ,Route = factor(`Universal IV`, levels=c(TRUE,FALSE), labels=c("IV", "PO"))
        ) %>%
  group_by(Arm, Route, Enrollment) %>%
  summarize(WC = sum(WC)) # ...but sum() converts WC to a count of TRUE's.

# This plot uses the 'trellis graphics' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple
# provided by R's lattice library. Notice how it achieves a direct and transparent
# display of your data, on Tufte's principle, "Above all else, show the data."
